# API-Challenge
Part of the analysis for Homework 06-Python-APIs


As a final consideration, we must complete our analysis of the Matplotlib and Pandas plots we made for WeatherPy using a Jupyter notebook.

In Part I, I include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.

In Part II, I include a screenshot of the combined Heatmap-Hotel Info Map created by my VacationPy script. 

All plots contain proper labeling, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.

For the Humidity heat map, I set the max_intensity to the highest humidity found in the data set.
